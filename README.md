# CS2063 Fall 2022 Lab Projects

This repository contains the labs to be used in the CS2063 Fall 2022 course at UNB.  New labs will be added as the semester goes on.

### Android Studio
* The code examples are built against and run in the Android Studio Chipmunk (2021.2.1 Patch 2)
* Should you use a different version you will be prompted to update the Gradle plugin used

## Android SDK
* For the most part the code uses API level 26 (Android Oreo 8.0) as a baseline
* Newer versions of the API can be used as well
* Please ensure that the correct SDK platforms are installed for the devices being used for testing

## Lab marking
Each lab will contain a list of deliverables which will need to be submitted upon completion.
